Hello Hansen, Kevin [USA],

The roles have been created as you requested. The trust for both is currently set for EC2. If this needs to be adjusted please let me know.

I have also sent you an encrypted email with the IAM user (service account) that was requested. The permissions associated with that user are the worker and control plane policies as well.

If you need any adjustments please let us know.

Thanks,

Josh Barnhart

Role #2:

Name: worker

Policy:

{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [

        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
]
}
In addition to the roles a service account will be needed. The roles, and account will be used inside the rancher management cluster to allow access to aws resources for use by rancher. The rancher management creates secrets to store the credentials it uses to create aws resources. The current strategy of credential management requires the use of a session token to generate temporary credentials. There is no way to include a session token when configuring the cloud credentials as the credentials are intended to be “long lived” .
